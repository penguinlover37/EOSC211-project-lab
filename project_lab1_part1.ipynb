    "Key to writing more complex code successfully (i.e. in reasonable time with minimal frustration) is planning out your algorithm BEFORE starting to code.  Here you will plan out the steps needed to compute a complete spacecraft trajectory given a starting position, velocity, total time of the flyby and the time interval at which you will compute the spacecraft position (and hence velocity and acceleration).\n",

    "Notice that there are a series of \"actions\" that are repeated at EACH point along the trajectory (time step). Furthermore each spacecraft position depends on the one before it.  So if you know where it is at time $t = 0$, and you know it's initial speeed, you can compute the spacecraft's acceleration, then for a given time interval $\\Delta t$ you can calculate the change in spacecraft position and velocity using Equations (10)-(13). The new position of the spacecraft after $\\Delta t$ is then the old position plus the change in position; same thing for velocity.\n",
