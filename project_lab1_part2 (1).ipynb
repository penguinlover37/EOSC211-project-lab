Where in your code will you add the call to `checkinit`? \n2.  What bits of code will go into `sc_vel_pos_change` and how/where will this function be called? \n3.  After doing 1 and 2: you'll notice that almost all of your pseudo code, except the definitions of initial conditions, time step and total trajectory duration will go into `get_traj`.  \n\n\n### Part 2C: Run a simulation:\n- Call your function `get_traj` with the following values for the various parameters needed. In your code, remember to convert everything to SI units (kg, m, s) before doing ANY calculations:  \n> - Mercury mass, $M_\\mathrm{p} = 3.3 \\times 10^{23}$ kg  \n> - Mercury radius, $R_\\mathrm{p} = 2440$ km.  Needed for spacecraft altitude determinations and plotting.\n> - Total time, $t_\\mathrm{f}$ = 40 minutes   \n> - Time increment, $\\Delta t = 60$ seconds  \n> - Initial position, $s_\\mathrm{x 0}=-3050 \\mathrm{~km}, s_\\mathrm{y 0}=-3 R_{p}$    \n> - Initial velocity, in positive y-direction with magnitude $7$ km s$^{−1}$  \n\nThese parameters simulate the flybys of Mercury by the MESSENGER spacecraft in 2008 and 2009 to alter the trajectory such that the spacecraft could be put into orbit around the planet in 2011.\n\n\n### Part 2D: Check it's all working:\n\nMake 2 figures (they should look like the ones in this notebook that are included after the function descriptions below): \n\n- **Figure 1** should plot the spacecraft trajectory in the x, y plane, along with a circle to denote the cross-section of Mercury. \n    \n- **Figure 2** should contain 3 subplots (3 rows, 1 column):   \n> - **Subplot 1**: (top) plot $a_x$, $a_y$, $|a|$ versus time (where $|a|$ is the magnitude of the acceleration vector).    \n> - **Subplot 2**: (middle) plot the speed $v$ versus time.   \n> - **Subplot 3**: (bottom) plot spacecraft altitude (height above planet’s surface) versus time.\n","metadata":{},"id":"33ac92fe"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"___\n\n## Function Definitions & Usage\n\nYour functions must perform as indicated in the descriptions below.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\nNote that for the all the new functions for Part 2 the functions <b>checkinit</b> , <b>sc_vel_pos_change</b> and <b>get_traj</b>, you should pass vector quantities (acceleration, velocity, position, change in velocity, change in position) in and out of functions as individual components separately (not as a list or array).
